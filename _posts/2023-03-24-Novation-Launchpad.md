The Novation Launchpad is a grid-based MIDI controller designed for Ableton Live, featuring RGB pads for launching clips, playing drums, and creating melodies. While it integrates seamlessly with Ableton Live, it can also be used with other MIDI-compatible software via manual mapping.<br>The Launchpad is USB MIDI class-compliant and can be repurposed for creative coding and hardware hacking. With USB Host support and MIDI libraries, it can be interfaced with platforms like Bela, Teensy, ESP32-S3, and others for custom installations and experimental instruments.
