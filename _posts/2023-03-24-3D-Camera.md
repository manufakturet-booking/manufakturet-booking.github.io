The JVC Everio GS-TD1 is a camcorder that records 3D video in Full HD using two lenses and sensors, similar to how human eyes work. You can watch the 3D footage directly on its built-in screen without needing 3D glasses, but it only works well when viewed from specific angles and distances — so it’s best for personal playback, not group viewing.
