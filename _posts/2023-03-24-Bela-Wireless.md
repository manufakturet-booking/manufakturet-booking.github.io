The original Bela board has everything you need to start creating beautifully interactive applications. With 8 16-bit analog I/O and 16 digital I/O you can hook up all your favourite sensors and devices, and get programming with our browser-based IDE. Bela is compatible with our multiplexer and audio expander capelets, and has on-board stereo amps, making this our most fully-featured system. Bela is available as a starter kit (full system including Bela cape + BeagleBone Black, USB cable, Bela cape and two audio adapter cables), or as a stand-alone cape.
