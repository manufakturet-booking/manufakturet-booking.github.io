![DDC-12 LCD DMX Controller](../../assets/images/equip/ld/1.webp)

The First line should be a link to an image, jpg, png webp all work, I have not tested others.
 The format should be ![Alternate image text](../../assets/images/equip/category/filename)
 We will have to upload the images to the relevant folders

Under the image comes the text, first the description.
 The description can be simple, and short, but it must assume that the reader knows little about the equipment or the fields of study related to it. This text is important because it not only describes the item to the reader, but is included in the search engine servicing the site.

There will also be a list of contents, formatted as below.

## KIT INCLUDES:
- Each list item starts with a dash
- The Kit includes title starts with a ##
- So does the drivers / Manuals title (below)
- This list is to ensure that borrowers know what they have to return

## Drivers / Manuals

[Manual](https://images.static-thomann.de/pics/atg/atgdata/document/manual/c_258125_v3_r1_en_online.pdf)

No text should be written after the links.
Any and all relevant links should be formatted exactly as above.
There can be multiple links, for example, a manual, drivers, getting started guide etc.

Finally, and most important: The md file name should be concise, clear, unique and informative. This name is used as the title of the equipment listed in the catalog. Name it so anyone will know what it is, not just the person who is borrowing it for the third time.

The first 11 characters of the title should be a date in yyyy-mm-dd- format. This is not used, but is required for the system to recognise the file as a post.

The file should be saved as markdown: .md

eg. 2023-01-01-Zoom-Q8-Mobile-Video-Audio-Recorder.md
