![DDC-12 LCD DMX Controller](../../assets/images/equip/ld/1.webp)
[//]:#  <!-- The First line should be a link to an image, jpg, png webbp all work, I have not tested others.
 The format should be ![Alternate image text](../../assets/images/equip/category/filename)
 We will have to upload the images to the relevant folders

Under the image comes the text, first comes the description
 The description can be simple, and short, but it must assume that the reader knows little about the equipment or the fields of study related to it. This text is important because it not only describes the item to the reader, but is included in the search engine servicing the site.-->

12 Channel DMX Controller

<!-- There will also be a list of contents, formatted as below -->

## KIT INCLUDES:
- DMX Controller
- Manual
- Power Supply

<!-- At the bottom of the listing there will be links to any relevant files - manuals, drivers, even research that has used the equipment -->
## Drivers / Manuals

[Manual](https://images.static-thomann.de/pics/atg/atgdata/document/manual/c_258125_v3_r1_en_online.pdf)

<!--Finally, and most important: The md file name should be concise, clear, unique and informative. This name is used as the title of the equipment listed in the catalog. Name it so anyone will know what it is, not just the person who is borrowing it for the third time.

The first 11 characters of the title should be a date in yyyy-mm-dd- format. This is not used, but is required for the system to recognise the file as a post.

The file should be saved as markdown: .md

eg. 2023-01-01-Zoom-Q8-Mobile-Video-Audio-Recorder.md
