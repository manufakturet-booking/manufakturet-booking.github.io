## Returning equipment

1. If you become aware that you can not return equipment on time, contact Manufakturet staff immediately
See the [terms of use](/_pages/terms) for more information.

Always try to contact a member of the booking staff before returning equipment. Make sure that the equipment being returned is:
	working, complete, packed in the same way that you borrowed it and where applicable, batteries have been removed.

When returning equipment directly to booking staff, make sure that they know your borrower ID, that the ID number of the equipment is readable,
and that you report any issues with the equipment.

If no staff are present you may place your equipment on the returns counter next to the booking office. Make sure that you write the following information 
in the returns book otherwise we cannot register the return of your equipment:
Date
Borrower ID
Equipent ID (typically starting AAU)
Any issues with the equipment
