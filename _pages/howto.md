By using the Booking system you confirm that you have read and understood the [Terms of service](/_pages/terms/). 

**Under no circumstances are students allowed to enter the booking room without a member of the booking staff present.**

## Borrowing Equipment
1. Browse this <a href="/_pages/equipmentListing.md/">catalog</a> to find the items that you want to borrow

2. Note any [category restrictions](/_pages/terms#restrictions) displayed for the items you are interested in borrowing *N.B SMILE or Lighting Design*

3. Locate the Equipment booking board in the CreaTech Lab, making sure that staff are present to complete your booking before removing any tags from the board

4. If there are no tags for your desired item on the board they are all currently lent out.

5. Tags hanging behind a reserved note have been prebooked for a particular future date. You may still borrow them, but it is imperative that they are returned BEFORE the prebooked date

6. Take the tags for the equipment that you want to borrow to a member of the booking staff

7. The staff member will ask you for the following information:
	- Whether you have obtained any necassary permissions for lending the equipment and meet any other requirements
	- How long you want each item - end of week, end of next week, end of month, end of next month, end of semester
	- Your borrower ID: The user name part of your student or staff email (This is the first part, preceding @student.aau.dk or @create.aau.dk)
