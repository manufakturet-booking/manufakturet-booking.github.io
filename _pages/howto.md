## Borrowing Equipment

# You will need a smartphone to borrow equipment

1. Browse the <a href="/_pages/equipmentListing.md/">catalog</a> to find the items that you want to borrow

2. Check any [category restrictions](/_pages/terms#restrictions) for the items you are interested in borrowing (Eg., SMILE or Lighting Design)

3. Go to the Equipment booking board in the CreaTech Lab. Ensure staff are present before removing any tags. <img src="../../assets/images/borrowingBoard.png" alt="booking board" width="300" style="margin: 10p" style="padding: 10px" style="border-radius: 20px;">

4. If there are no tags for your desired item on the board they are all currently lent out.

5. Tags hanging behind a reserved note have been prebooked for a future date. You may still borrow them, but must return them before the prebooked date

6. Take the tags to a member of the booking staff

7. The staff member will verify any necessary permissions and requirements

8. The staff member will locate the equipment and ask you to scan the QR code in the booking room to generate an email.

9. You must ensure this email includes:
	- Your email address
	- A list of all AAU numbers for the equipment you are borrowing
	- Your intended return date

10. Send the email to complete the borrowing process.

## Returning equipment

1. If you become aware that you can not return equipment on time, contact the CreaTech Lab staff immediately
See the [terms of use](/_pages/terms) for more information

2. Always try to contact a member of the booking staff before returning equipment. Make sure that the equipment being returned is:
	- working
	- complete
	- packed in the same way that you borrowed it
	- where applicable, batteries have been removed

3. When returning equipment directly to booking staff, make sure that they know your borrower ID, that the ID number of the equipment is readable,
and that you report any issues with the equipment.

4. If no staff are present you may place your equipment on the returns counter next to the booking office. Make sure that you write the following information 
in the returns book otherwise we cannot register the return of your equipment:
	- Date
	- Your borrower ID
	- Equipent ID (typically starting AAU)
	- Any issues with the equipment
