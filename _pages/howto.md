By using the Booking system you confirm that you have read and understood the [Terms of service](/terms/). 

**Under no circumstances are students allowed to enter the booking room without a member of the booking staff present.**

## Borrowing Equipment
1. Browse this catalog to find the items that you want to borrow

2. Note the category that the items are lsited in (SMILE, Lighting, All of MTC) and take the relevant restrictions into account [(see terms of service)](https://manufakturet-booking.github.io/_pages/terms#restriction)

Locate the Equipment booking board in Manufakturet, making sure that staff are present to complete your booking before removing any tags from the board.

Here you can see if the equipment is physically available for lending out, and if it has been booked.

Take the tags for the equipment that you want to borrow to a member of the booking staff.

The staff member will ask you for the following information:
		Whether you have obtained any necassary permissions for lending the equipment and meet any other requirements
		How long you want each item - end of week, end of next week, end of month, end of next month, end of semester
		Your borrower ID: The user name part of your student or staff email (The part that precedes @*.aau.dk)

## Returning equipment

If you become aware that you can not return equipment on time, contact Manufakturet staff immediately
See the terms of use for more information.

Always try to contact a member of the booking staff before returning equipment. Make sure that the equipment being returned is:
	working, complete, packed in the same way that you borrowed it and where applicable, batteries have been removed.

When returning equipment directly to booking staff, make sure that they know your borrower ID, that the ID number of the equipment is readable,
and that you report any issues with the equipment.

If no staff are present you may place your equipment on the returns counter next to the booking office. Make sure that you write the following information 
in the returns book otherwise we cannot register the return of your equipment:
Date
Borrower ID
Equipent ID (typically starting AAU)
Any issues with the equipment
