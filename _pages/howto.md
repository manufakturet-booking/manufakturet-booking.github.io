## Borrowing Equipment

# You will need a smartphone to borrow equipment

1. Browse the <a href="/_pages/equipmentListing.md/">catalog</a> to find the items that you want to borrow

2. Check any [category restrictions](/_pages/terms#restrictions) for the items you are interested in borrowing (Eg., SMILE or Lighting Design)

3. Go to the Equipment booking board in the CreaTech Lab. Ensure staff are present before removing any tags. <img src=“…/…/assets/images/borrowingBoard.png” alt=“booking-board” width=“300” style=“margin: 10px padding: 10px; border-radius: 20px;”>

4. If there are no tags for your desired item on the board they are all currently lent out.

5. Tags hanging behind a reserved note have been prebooked for a future date. You may still borrow them, but must return them before the prebooked date

6. Take the tags for the equipment that you want to borrow to a member of the booking staff

7. The staff member will ask whether you have obtained any necessary permissions for lending the equipment and meet any other requirements

8. The staff member will find the equipment for you and ask you to scan the QR code in the booking room. This will generate an email for you to edit.

9. The staff member will ensure that you have entered all the necessary information in the email:
	- Your email address
	- A list of all AAU numbers for the equipment you are borrowing
	- Your intended return date

10. Once you have sent that email you may borrow the equipment.

## Returning equipment

1. If you become aware that you can not return equipment on time, contact the CreaTech Lab staff immediately
See the [terms of use](/_pages/terms) for more information

2. Always try to contact a member of the booking staff before returning equipment. Make sure that the equipment being returned is:
	- working
	- complete
	- packed in the same way that you borrowed it
	- where applicable, batteries have been removed

3. When returning equipment directly to booking staff, make sure that they know your borrower ID, that the ID number of the equipment is readable,
and that you report any issues with the equipment.

4. If no staff are present you may place your equipment on the returns counter next to the booking office. Make sure that you write the following information 
in the returns book otherwise we cannot register the return of your equipment:
	- Date
	- Your borrower ID
	- Equipent ID (typically starting AAU)
	- Any issues with the equipment
