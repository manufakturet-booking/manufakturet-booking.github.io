This is in index.html

# Todo
- figure out how to display tags (see below) on each category page (smile, create, lighting design), filtered by category
- Display restriction information on each post by layouts
- reduce font size
- create a script, potentially in matlab, to populate the page with posts, from an excel sheet as a data source (300+ items are in the booking system)
